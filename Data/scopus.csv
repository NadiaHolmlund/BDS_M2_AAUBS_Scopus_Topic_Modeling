Under the multi-level institutional settings such as China, however, it is unclear in current literature as to whether central and local-level governmental R&D subsidy programs exert heterogeneous influences on recipient firms’ exploratory innovation. By employing an exclusive panel data of manufacturing firms in Jiangsu Province, this study investigates the heterogeneous effects of central and local R&D subsidies on firms’ exploratory innovation. Considering that regional innovation contexts may influence the learning and innovation of subsidy recipients, we further test the interaction effects of specialized industrial agglomeration and R&D subsidies. We find that R&D subsidies in general do promote firms’ exploratory innovation, and the local R&D subsidy exhibits a more salient effect. In addition, the positive effect of subsidies is stronger for the recipients in a highly specialized industrial agglomeration. This study contributes to R&D subsidy literature and extends our knowledge on the different roles of central and local governments in firms’ learning behaviors and technological upgrading. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101066073

A hybrid electricity/hydrogen/gas/refueling station (EHGRS) powered by renewable energy in an off-grid region is proposed. It supplies electricity for electric vehicles (EVs), and hydrogen for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) and produces natural gas for natural gas vehicles (NGVs) simultaneously. A hybrid stochastic/information gap decision theory (IGDT) optimization method is employed for the scheduling problem of the hybrid EHGRS in an uncertain environment. The uncertainties of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power is modelled via scenarios, while the uncertainties of the demands of EVs, HFCVs and NGVs, depending on human behavior, are formulated with a bi-level IGDT method without knowing the accurate distribution information. The work aims to find the maximum expected profits of the hybrid EHGRS. Two different scheduling strategies, i.e. risk-averse and risk-seeker, with two contradictory attitudes under the uncertain demands are proposed. Results indicate that 1) The proposed hybrid EHGRS can simultaneously provide different fuels to EVs, HFCVs and NGVs. 2) Under the same condition, the profit for the risk-averse scheduling is decreased and the risk-seeker scheduling is increased, compared to the results obtained by the pure stochastic optimization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109437255

In this way, a large number of retired electric vehicle batteries (REVB) will be produced in a short time and cause new environmental pollution if REVB are not treated properly. To address this problem, one of the major solutions is to realize the echelon utilization of REVB based on the requirements of different application scenarios. Therefore, this study investigates the economic benefits of REVB participating in different Danish electricity markets. The objective function maximizes the profit in the different markets with considering REVB life loss cost in the operational process. Rainflow counting method is employed to accurately estimate the REVB life loss cost, leading to a strong nonlinearity of the optimization problem. Afterward, simulated annealing based particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) method is used to solve the nonlinear problem and find the optimal operational strategies of the REVB. Finally, a case study with considering different situations is provided to analyze the economic benefits of applying REVB in different markets. The results reveal: 1) SAPSO method performs best in finding the optimal results compared with particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing methods, and 2) It is more likely and beneficial to invest in REVB to participate in the regulation market than the day-ahead market. This significance of the study can be summarized as: 1) Theoretically, apart from proposing a simple, cheap and eco-friendly green strategy, i.e., the echelon utilization of REVB in Danish electricity market, we advance the knowledge and call for attention about under which conditions that performing a green strategy can allow environmental-economic benefits simultaneously achievable. 2) The study provides new business opportunities for energy storage and new energy industries, and can help to realize sustainable development to improve people's life and environmental quality. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097913846

The paper, therefore, studies the link between LM and I4.0 from a learning organization (LO) perspective by examining the implementation, commissioning, and utilization of a real-time operational data gathering system at a Danish building material manufacturer. This six months in-depth case study finds that for the manufacturer to utilize real-time operational data from a LO perspective, several barriers must be addressed: problem solving that is not initiated by operators, operators who do not have second-order problem-solving abilities, operators who perceive the new real-time data technology as coercive, poor learning environments and processes, and a lack of leadership that supports learning. This study can help practitioners understand the importance of balance, the prevalent technocentric focus when implementing new I4.0 technologies with a LO focus. Furthermore, the study provides practitioners with a list of specific barriers from a LO perspective to be mindful of when aiming to combine LM and I4.0 to improve production performance. © 2020 by the authors.

This research is based on a new hybrid method developed by the authors, called Advanced, Reasoned and Organised (ARO) literature review, which improves the quality of literature reviews by integrating the systematic review for quantitative papers, the meta-synthesis for qualitative research and the critical interpretative analysis. Forty-eight articles were included in the literature review. Bibliometric and cluster analyses were carried out. Two hypotheses were applied as filters in the interpretative synthesis of the content and guided the analysis to answer two research questions. The findings underline that RM in SMEs is still a ‘spot’ subject as they put little effort into the risk identification, assessment and monitoring. The lack of procedures and strategies is due to the lack of risk mindfulness and knowledge, and it is related to the managers’ and owners’ risk attitudes. It is fundamental to understand why risk procedures are not implemented and to find a way to raise awareness of the potential benefits of risk and control measures. The topic is current, and the multidisciplinary perspective and mixed-method approach enhance both theoretical and practical contributions for academics and SME owners. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096819200

Fruitful implementation of CTNs will leverage environmental and socio-economic goals of sustainable development in the freight transport sector. The benefits of CTNs in horizontal collaborative settings have been widely demonstrated through several modelling approaches. However, in practice, the real applications of CTNs have been challenging and most did not achieve satisfactory performances. Some studies have addressed this issue by identifying different barriers to CTN implementation. However, a conceptual framework for the barriers is not well-established. In addition, the literature lacks a decision-making framework for the CTN implementation which considers the different barriers. To address this gap, this paper conducted a literature review of the barriers to CTN implementation. In total, 31 different barriers were identified. A conceptual barrier framework is developed by grouping the 31 barriers into five categories: the business model, information sharing, the human factors, the Collaborative Decision Support Systems (CDSSs), and the market. The paper additionally proposes a stage-gate model integrating the conceptual barrier framework into the CTN implementation decision-making process. The current work contributes to the existing literature by developing both theoretical and practical understandings of the barriers to implementing CTNs and will support decision makers in CTN implementation to maximize the CTN benefits and minimize the risk of CTN failure. © 2021, The Author(s).",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114693206

The conceptual model consists of four forces leading to a successful business. Design/methodology/approach: The sample is a stratified one taken from KOMPASS directory and focussing on the Greater Manchester area. In total, 250 firms were chosen to be the population of this survey. In total, 110 surveys were received by email i.e. 24 non-exporters and 86 exporters that were fully completed. Findings: The four forces of the model include the non-exporting activity, the activity before and after the first export order, differences and similarities between non-exporters and exporters and the regular exporting activity. This model’s findings demonstrate important empirical determinants related to four forces, which, in turn, shape the successful exporting activity. Originality/value: The empirical evidence from the study suggests that the major differences between non-exporters and exporters, which include the differences in management perceptions towards exporting, and the differences and similarities of firm and management characteristics, explain only to some degree what constitutes successful exporting behaviour. The model is considered useful for smaller businesses located in the UK. The study highlights the importance of firms before and after the first export order, which provides insights for managers of firms about going through with the first export order rather than withdrawing from this effort. The study reveals the motivations for exporting, the timing, the modes through which firms export, firms’ management characteristics and attitudinal differences between exporters and non-exporters, which are essential for practitioners. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100190207

The authors draw upon neo-Durkheimian institutional and legitimacy theories and elements of the accounting and risk management literature to discuss the challenges that the pandemic poses to risk recognition and assessment and the subsequent disclosure decision of risk information. Findings: Risk reporting has its roots in risk recognition and assessment. To live up to their accountability in these times of uncertainty, organisations need to address their stakeholders' new and changing information needs. Ad hoc disclosures and linking risk management and reporting to their business models (BM) would improve the risk recognition and assessment practices and the meaningfulness of the disclosed information. Hence, we provide some examples and discuss potential avenues to address these challenges and adapt risk reporting accordingly. Originality/value: This conceptual paper contributes to the risk reporting and accountability research fields. Previous studies on communication during a crisis have focused on sustainability reporting. Thus, this study contributes to that literature by considering the role of risk reporting in times of an unexpected large-scale global crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and by highlighting possibilities for moving risk reporting towards becoming more accountability based. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107837685

The study found that compared to decentralized decision-making, the level of green technology and the total profit of green channels are higher under centralized decision-making. When the coordination parameters are within a certain range, the dynamic wholesale price mechanism can coordinate the behavior of manufacturers and retailers. The result also discovers that under the dynamic wholesale price mechanism, with the increase of investment cost coefficient, or the increase of price sensitivity or the decrease of consumer's environmental awareness, the green technology level, product green degree, price, retailer's profit, and the total profit of green channel is decreased.

The approach will result in agent behavior that encompasses a wide range of so-called cognitive biases, as seen in the scientific literature of behavioral economics, but instead of using these biases as further indications of market inefficiencies or market failures, the paper will likewise attempt to show the limits to which these biases can inform or critique standard economic theory.

The authors identify current trends, analyse and critique the key topics of research and discuss the future of this nascent field of inquiry. Design/methodology/approach: This study’s analysis combined a structured literature review with citation analysis, topic modelling using a machine learning approach and a manual review of selected articles. The corpus comprised 153 academic papers from two ranked journal lists, the Association of Business Schools (ABS) and the Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC), and from the Social Science Research Network (SSRN). From this, the authors analysed and critiqued the current and future research trends in the four most predominant topics of research in blockchain for accounting. Findings: Blockchain is not yet a mainstream accounting topic, and most of the current literature is normative. The four most commonly discussed areas of blockchain include the changing role of accountants; new challenges for auditors; opportunities and challenges of blockchain technology application; and the regulation of cryptoassets. While blockchain will likely be disruptive to accounting and auditing, there will still be a need for these roles. With the sheer volume of information that blockchain records, both professions may shift out of the back-office toward higher-profile advisory roles where accountants try to align competitive intelligence with business strategy, and auditors are called on ex ante to verify transactions and even whole ecosystems. Research limitations/implications: The authors identify several challenges that will need to be examined in future research. Challenges include skilling up for a new paradigm, the logistical issues associated with managing and monitoring multiple parties all contributing to various public and private blockchains, and the pressing need for legal frameworks to regulate cryptoassets. Practical implications: The possibilities that blockchain brings to information disclosure, fraud detection and overcoming the threat of shadow dealings in developing countries all contribute to the importance of further investigation into blockchain in accounting.

Yet, commentators debate whether U.S. corporations have indeed moved toward a stakeholder orientation, given the difficulties in measuring such a shift. We assess this shift by examining corporate governance practices, especially the prevalence of shareholder- and stakeholder-oriented practices in chief executive officer (CEO) dismissals. Using data on large firms in 1980–2015, we found that, before the 2000s, CEOs were less heavily penalized for poor firm performance when they demonstrated a shareholder orientation by downsizing and refocusing the corporation and more heavily penalized for CSR activity. This trend, however, reversed after the early 2000s. This article provides evidence of the evolution of U.S. firms' governance practices from a shareholder toward stakeholder orientation. Managerial Summary: Many people are skeptical of the assertion that U.S. corporations have become more stakeholder-oriented over time. It is no wonder, as scant evidence exists for this claim. We tackle this claim head on by analyzing firm practices in 1980–2015 that contributed to chief executive officer (CEO) dismissal when the firm was performing poorly. Some practices, such as downsizing and firm refocusing, are associated with a shareholder orientation and others, such as CSR, are associated with a stakeholder orientation. We found strong evidence for a growing trend toward a stakeholder orientation. When the firm was performing poorly before the 2000s, CEOs were more likely to be dismissed for CSR activities and less likely to be dismissed for downsizing or refocusing the firm.

Additionally, we find that board characteristics (board size and gender) affect a bank’s systemic risk, but for small banks only. Overall, our evidence suggests that the traditional banks’ size-focused approach to systemic risk study should be complemented with governance dimensions, especially in a context like the European one, where ownership concentration is high. Our results also imply that practitioners and policymakers should promote better governance practices in banks in the form of more adequate ownership and board structures that are better able to control systemic risk. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103384332

Design/methodology/approach: In total, the study uses 138 peer-reviewed articles on effectuation, causation, effectual/causal decision-making logics and related issues such as the impact of antecedent factors of international strategy (i.e. effectuation, causation and bricolage) on the international performance of the firm. Findings: Even though the theory of effectuation was formulated in 2001, to a large extent it has still not moved away from the realm of small entrepreneurial firms. The development of effectuation logic has accelerated in recent years, but the bulk of the research still focusses on small entrepreneurial firms rather than on the application of the theory in larger, non-entrepreneurial firms. Furthermore, effectuation theory would benefit from being developed into the realm of psychology and sociology. Originality/value: This study offers a conceptual model on how effectuation, causation and bricolage influence internationalisation strategy, which, in turn, impacts the international performance of the firm. Furthermore, the study discusses the effectual logic for larger firms. The exponential growth of studies on effectuation during recent years, i.e. 2017 to the first quarter of 2020, shows that researchers have responded to calls by leading authors stating that effectuation theory is a field with great potential for further theoretical developments.

The underlying premise is that if a firm continues to collaborate with a university, it must consider that collaboration to be valuable. A quantitative analysis of over 2600 firms reveals that persistence is relatively common in university–industry collaborations on innovation, with more than a third of firms that engage in university collaboration continuing to collaborate with the same university over two consecutive periods. In addition, the analysis shows that firms’ investments in collaborative capabilities and different dimensions of absorptive capacity are instrumental for persistent collaboration with a university. Furthermore, persistent collaboration with a university is strongly associated with the strategic choice to engage in sustained collaboration with a broad range of partner types. Finally, the analysis reveals that geographical proximity between a firm and a university may facilitate the initiation of a collaboration, although the nearest university is not necessarily the most suitable partner. This is illustrated by the finding that geographical proximity between a firm and a university does not matter for keeping together in a persistent collaboration. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115146189

The reforms follow in the wake of a year-long debate on the relevance of the regional level for policies, which also includes a debate on which actors are relevant at different levels of aggregation. The policy reform of 2019 appears to centralise how business support is provided and also to possibly decouple some of the already established systemic links between actors. Although the new business promotion policy setup in Denmark does acknowledge that the decentralised business promotion effort should take its point of departure in local and regional growth challenges and framework conditions, there is a clear move towards simplification in organisation and actors, as well as in policy means. The precise, adequate configuration of the innovation system and its support infrastructure is difficult to determine ex ante and surely needs to be seen in a specific systemic context. © Designs and Patents Act 1988.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104707622

Relying upon the Uppsala model as applied in light of a firm case study, we contribute to the validity of the Uppsala model 2017. We respond to the counterpoint by Coviello, Kano, and Liesch (2017) to the Uppsala 2017 model, answering the question, What is the impact of Industry 4.0 on the validity of the 2017 version of the Uppsala model? This study builds on a qualitative research methodology through a single case study of Delivery Hero, a global service provider firm. We adopt an extensive longitudinal approach to understand a startup firm's digital business concept and business evolution, including its internationalization paths. We conclude that the mechanisms of the Uppsala model are valid, but their characteristics have changed by digital and globalized value-adding processes. The dynamic capabilities possessed by the founding entrepreneur turn out to constitute a critical micro foundation for the firm's international business success. Our findings explain these change mechanisms, illustrating the stepwise progression process led by entrepreneurial decision-making. Industry 4.0 technologies have changed the very manner by which ﬁrms arrange their value-adding activities with their business stakeholders in course of the firm's internationalization. By relying on reasonable business targets, algorithms, and data management systems, real-time market monitoring enables international startup firms to learn and adopt local identities faster, thereby efficiently alleviating liabilities of foreignness. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126034384

Drawing on the concept of family identity bundles and interviews with Danish and New Zealand grandparents and grandchildren, it was found that, for both generations, being alone together was a treat in itself and a time for treats, although they were fluent in the discourse of balance and moderation. Grandparents’ food-related practices were shaped by the internalized as well as actual presence of the parents, but they tended to experience rather than express tensions over parental feeding practices.

New innovative technologies can support farmers in a more targeted planning of fertilizer application and crop management at the field level to increase the effect of measures when reducing nitrogen losses. However, if farmers do not perceive the need for such a concept, the demand (market pull) will be minimal, making the implementation of such a technology difficult. The lack of this market pull could, however, be counterbalanced by a market push from research or requirements from public sector stakeholders (regulators). Within this domain, the main objective of this paper was to study technological change over time and identify and understand the crucial stakeholder involvement using the Functions of Innovation Systems Approach. This article shows how stakeholders’ perceptions and participation evolved over a 10-year period. It examines the interplay between technology readiness and the perceived readiness and acceptance by affected stakeholders. We demonstrate how stakeholder engagement was crucial to ensure the development of the technologies by creating marketable options for their future implementation. A key dynamic that emerged in this process was the transition from a research push to a regulator pull. We demonstrate the fact that without the regulatory requirement linked to changes towards more targeting of measures, the technology would not, on its own, be a business case, although it would provide new knowledge, thus representing a gain for society. The specific findings can be used in countries where new technologies need to be developed, and where a link to the regulation can ensure the active use of the new technology and, therefore, make their implementation worthwhile. © 2021 by the authors.

However, these exists in disparate literature, that provides limited oversight to managers in, that need to select between a manifold of different entrepreneurial strategies. Moreover, these approaches typically originate from a distinctively different organizational context, namely SMEs. Through a literature review we identify two important axiomatic assumptions concerning entrepreneurial strategies within the organizational conditions of MNCs. The first fundamental assumption concerns the organizational origin of such effort. The second theoretical assumption deals with how the entrepreneurial initiative can meet either organizational resistance or support. We synthesize these two dimensions into a two-by-two matrix, that provides an answer to our research question: what are the critical dimensions for entrepreneurial strategies in an MNC context? We then employ this typology to categorize predominant entrepreneurial strategies in current literature, to create a overview that can be used both for structuring the debate in the literature; as well as a basis to discuss important implicit assumptions, that should guide the selection of entrepreneurial strategy in a MNC context in practice. © The Author(s) 2020.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097999139

The authors adopt action research to generate actionable knowledge from a two-year-long action learning intervention at the Danish rooftop window manufacturer VELUX. Findings: Drawing on emergent insights from the action learning intervention, it was found that a learning-to-learn capability based on lean was a core construct and enabler for manufacturers to adopt Industry 4.0 successfully. Institutionalizing an organizational learning scaffold encompassing the intertwined learning processes of systems Alpha, Beta and Gamma served as a significant way to develop a learning-to-learn capability for Industry 4.0 adoption (systematic problem-solving abilities, leaders as learning facilitators, presence of a supportive learning environment and Industry 4.0 knowledge).

However, hierarchical governance in the form of vertical integration is still preferred in many industries for organizing innovation, and the current literature touches little on the relative performance of different organizational structures (integrated firms vs innovation ecosystem) and the factors that lead firms to choose one over the other. The authors conjecture that structure of technological interdependence is one of such important factors. Using a computational experiment, the authors compare the innovation performance of ecosystems with integrated firms under different interdependency structures. Design/methodology/approach: Using the NKC model, the authors incorporate non-generic complementarities and modularity into the technological interdependence between different components. The authors compare four different types of technological interdependence (modular, hierarchical, nearly modular, and random). Findings: The results show that integrated firms with centralized search demonstrate stable and consistent performance that is robust to the structure of technological interdependencies, but an ecosystem significantly outperforms integrated firms with centralized or decentralized when the products exhibit modular or nearly-modular structures. Originality/value: This study sheds light on why an ecosystem often exhibits modular structures while vertical integration is prevalent in industries with complex technological interdependence.

In this article, the CH-X12 /STL-X framework for e-waste recycling scale prediction is proposed based on the idea of ‘decomposition-integration’, considering that the seasonal data characteristics of quarterly e-waste recycling scale data may lead to large forecasting errors and inconsistent forecasting results of a traditional single model. First, the seasonal data characteristics of the time series of e-waste recovery scale are identified based on Canova–Hansen (CH) test, and then the time series suitable for seasonal decomposition is extracted with X12 or seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess (STL) model for seasonal components.

Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study of a qualitative nature was conducted using a self-administered open-ended questionnaire among tourists who had stayed in an Airbnb in the past three years. Data were collected using two different sources for triangulation purposes, referred to as Studies 1 and 2. Findings: Many respondents reported conducting similar activities while at home and while staying in an Airbnb, supporting Burch’s (1969) spill-over theory. Travellers mostly recalled mundane activities, such as cooking. The results suggest that the spill-over effect is more prevalent in the Airbnb context than in other accommodation types, as one often travels from one’s own home to another’s home. Respondents associated their Airbnb experience with the positive emotion of joy. Respondents mentioned numerous reasons for having felt joy during their Airbnb experiences, such as sharing the trip with travel companions and spending time with friends. Practical implications: Airbnb should clearly define host’s tasks and responsibilities, hosts should treat guests in a friendly manner, which includes resolving any problems they face in relation to the rental property. Originality/value: This paper proposes a new conceptual framework for a memorable Airbnb experience, which comprises several components: socialising and bonding with friends and family members, location, the host’s hospitality, a homely feeling, home amenities and negative experiences (the poor condition of the room and a dishonest host). © 2021, Erose Sthapit, Peter Björk Dafnis N.

Nevertheless, most research treats this dissolution with a sense of finality. Using the Danish Integrated Database for Labor Market Research (IDA), we explore the persistence of cofounders and early employees to continue their work relationships after the dissolution of the new venture. We investigate where these team members continue their career and whether they pursue entrepreneurship together in another new venture. Overall, over 18.3% move jointly, and comobility is more prevalent among new venture team members who worked jointly prior to founding the new venture and among those new venture teams demonstrating high levels of homogeneity. Moreover, comovers tend toward small firms, and comobility occurs largely in similar industry. A large share of comovers move to new ventures, which is indicative of serial or habitual new venture teams. This also raises further question on team-level dimension of learning from failure. © 2021, The Author(s).",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116267366

In this paper, we study how customers with low leverage manage the process of mobilizing supplier resources critical for innovation. We present findings from a single case study of a buying firm and show how they use five elements to gradually become attractive in the eyes of a critical supplier: proactive technological competence, canvassing and continuous communication, supplier learning, market access, and relationship maintenance. The different elements play different roles during the process of mobilizing supplier resources. We show that mobilizing suppliers in the case of low-leverage customers is a long-term process in which a number of interrelated attractiveness elements are leveraged in a complex pattern.

AI may enhance or augment skills through, for example, the increased use of high-performance work practices, or it may increase work pace constraints and reduce employee autonomy. The results imply that the diffusion of AI can increase inequalities in the labour market by augmenting skills used in high-skill jobs, although having relatively more adverse impacts on other jobs.

Content analysis is used to assess the mandatory disclosure of BM in in 75 publicly listed companies' annual reports across a three-year period (2014–2016). The research applies a novel content analysis methodology that considers the way in which the relevance of BM disclosures is dependent on which particular BM a given company adopts. The empirical results show notably low levels of BM disclosure and no significant association between BM disclosures and market value. However, we find that BM disclosure provides insights into earnings quality by means of enhanced earnings persistence. These findings reveal that information about the BM itself does not make a difference to investors when it is not linked to financial outcomes. Instead, BM acts as a framework for organizing other disclosures, and provides complementary information about value generation, helping users understand how earnings are generated.

High-performer mobility induces a loss of human assets but might also enable competition by transferring human and complementary assets from the parent firm to a competitor. Only when such transfer occurs is mobility to same-industry startups more harmful than other types of high-performer mobility. Human and complementary asset transfer is conditional on the departing high performer's ability to accumulate (and hence transfer) knowledge from the parent firm and the recipient firm's ability to absorb such knowledge. In support of this hypothesis, we show that the high performer's tenure and the startup's resources (size) moderate the performance effect of high-performer mobility on same-industry startups. Managerial Summary: Industry experience is critical for new venture performance, and spinoff entrepreneurs (former employees from the same industry) perform better than other start-ups. However, studies have found that high performers' mobility to spinoffs harms the performance of their former employers. This paper asks when do spinoffs result in increasing competition and when is spinoff entrepreneurship more harmful compared to other types of high performer mobility? We show that additional detrimental performance effects on former employers depend on employee tenure and the spinoffs' start-up size. We argue that longer tenure increases competition because it allows the employee to form and strengthen personal relations, for example, to customers, and to accumulate more knowledge on products and processes. Start-up size is important for the recreation and appropriation of this knowledge. © 2021 Strategic Management Society.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108366764

The seafood sector is not only among the culprits, but is also among the most affected by this threat to the marine environment. Earlier research has pointed to fishing gear take-back schemes as a measure to mitigate the problem, and policymakers have embraced the idea. The Norwegian scheme for beverage containers has been hailed as a benchmark for the application of Extended Producer Responsibility. Through the lens of business ecosystems, we draw parallels between the existing take-back scheme for beverage containers and the latent system for fishing gear to answer the question: “What would it take to establish a take-back scheme for fishing gear?” We elaborate upon four factors that are well established for beverage container take-back schemes, but lacking or unclear in the case of fishing gear: (i) politico-institutional support, (ii) the system's value proposition, (iii) the system integrator, and (iv) operational factors (i.e., a network of collection points and procedures, and material variety and complexity). Our findings highlight that when innovations are not based on the usual market mechanisms, unconventional conceptualizations of value itself and how value is mapped and distributed are required. Meaningful engagement of the private sector depends upon either explicit articulation of value capture or policy instruments to enforce responsibility; both are currently either unclear or lacking in the context of fishing gear. © 2022 The Authors.

Findings: Absorptive capacity ensures the long-term survival and success of a business. To develop absorptive capacity successfully, firms should focus on its various dimensions and existing intangible assets and external environment.

To date, however, we know little about how this sequential process unfolds and what managers can do to deal with incoherence. This paper contributes by enhancing the understanding of sequential changes, drawing on the organizational ecology literature, and we empirically inform our research with a five-year longitudinal case study. Our data illustrates in detail how initial MC changes, intended to cope with an environmental shift, trigger a cascade effect. This sequential process results in an extensive change period, during which various incoherent MC elements coexist. Our study acknowledges that incoherence among MC elements can decrease control effectiveness by creating intra-organizational frictions, yet we highlight the role of managers in mitigating such negative effects.

Second, what other factors play a mediating role in this effect?

Using the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and related targets as overall performance measures for sustainable development the Danish innovation system is performing relatively well but still with major challenges before the 2030 targets are achieved - especially in relation to sustainable cities, consumption, production, climate action and ‘life below water’. It is argued that although the 17 SDGs may serve as important signposts and wake-up calls for policy action, the notion of the learning economy where learning and capability building are at the centre provides a relevant supplementary starting point for formulating policies for a transition to a more sustainable development path. The chapter turns finally to a wider perspective on sustainable development and raises the question of whether the meaning of sustainable development needs to be rethought in the Anthropocene era with significant human impact on the Earth’s ecosystem. © Designs and Patents Act 1988.",Book Chapter,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104744583

The analysis is divided into 3 periods: before and after the VAT hike and during the financial crisis, with the total time period from 2003 to 2013. The sample is composed of 23,388 Portuguese unique firms with 5.1 year-observations per firm. The impact of the massive VAT change is assessed in comparison to the performance of 4,969 Greek and 59,841 Spanish (for robustness) unique firms for the exact time period. The results show that a dramatic VAT increase significantly affects firm profitability in the country of implementation, with the effect even more dramatic than the recent financial crisis. The equivalent to the proposed 10 percent VAT rise in Portugal has caused a significant decline in firm profitability (an average drop of 8.7% compared to 1.5% during the financial crisis), a massive increase in the number of inactive firms and amplified the likelihood of firms to become bankrupt by about three times. Such consequences inevitably affect unemployment and may cause a slump in tax revenue in the long run. Hence, this research has wide practical implications and should be considered by the Greek and Portuguese governments before taking a next step of intervening in the tourism sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093656660

Top management, middle management and staff specialists at a medium-sized Danish municipality are interviewed. Findings: The paper demonstrates how accounting metaphors can be effective in linking cost information and cost-consciousness to operational decisions in daily work practices. Further, the study elucidates how professionalism may be strengthened based on the use of accounting information. Research limitations/implications: The study is context specific, and the role of accounting in professional work varies on the basis of the specific techniques involved. Practical implications: The paper shows how managers influence how professionals interpret and use accounting information. It shows how cost-consciousness can be integrated with social work practices to improve service quality. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature on how accounting information influences social work.

The loss of orders from global retailers in developed economies has worsened the living conditions for many garment-industry workers in emerging economies, such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and Vietnam. Many suppliers in these countries have remained locked into relatively low-value, low-margin, low-skilled activities. However, in a relatively little noticed phenomenon, some suppliers have been able to upgrade their capabilities and have internationalized, establishing facilities abroad to strengthen ties to existing buyers. The contributions to this book document this phenomenon, highlighting the factors that promote or hinder higher levels of internationalization, the conditions that influence the development of suppliers’ capabilities, and how some firms achieve higher levels of sustainable production. They do so from various perspectives, including international business, global value chain, strategy, innovation, operations management and sociological perspectives. Together the book’s chapters represent an important contribution to the literature, focusing on important aspects of GVCs using firm-centric analysis that the existing literature tends to downplay. By enabling us to understand those challenges better, those contributions can help to provide ways for suppliers to overcome them. Collectively, therefore, we hope the chapters in this book offer a positive message for suppliers, multinational buyers, and workers within GVCs during a time of unprecedented challenges. © Mohammad B.

MNCs play an important role in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) formulated by the United Nations (UN), as they are responsible for one-third of the total economic output and the majority of world trade. However, little is known about how MNCs contribute to meeting the UN SDGs. Through an in-depth analysis of how Grundfos, a Danish MNC and a leading supplier of pumps, developed a solution for supplying fresh potable water to rural villages in Kenya, we investigate some challenges MNCs face and demonstrate the importance of intimate engagement with the context of strategic action. Tackling sustainable development issues in the context of BoP markets represents a distinctive challenge to MNCs, which often do not have a good understanding of BoP environments. Drawing on contrasting ideas of strategy as navigation or wayfaring, we highlight the dangers of trying to impose existing strategies and business practices in market contexts, which are fundamentally different from existing ones. We add to the existing research by exploring how such frameworks interact with strategizing processes in a novel environment for the operating firm.

The late globalization phenomena are multilevel and multidimensional; this paper offers an initial portal into these phenomena. Understanding late globalization would provide academic insights and help in shaping practices at international, national, sectoral, and corporate levels. The paper follows a macro-conceptual to a micro-empirical path to provide illustrative empirical evidence. Studying the emergence and evolution of Danish Textile and Fashion Industry (DTFI) between 1945 and 2015—a quintessential sector for globalization—allows the examination of several interrelated issues: critical events, impediments, pressures, and turning points that shaped DTFI; main institutional players that motivated key policy changes in and evolution of DTFI; and effects of late globalization on size, mission, location, knowledge, growth, and structure of DTFI. This longitudinal case study of the development of the DTFI brings to the fore key features that shape late globalization at the sectoral-national level: government industrial policies toward domestic and foreign players in an industry, global competition that shapes and continually reshapes (cost as well as quality-driven) location of key value chain activities (and the concomitant global distribution of core competencies and skills), and the growing role of information technologies that enable globally-dispersed value chains to function in cohesive and unified ways. Late globalization has additional levels and dimensions; and we point to implications for future research. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086331228

This study posits that this is not a reasonable approach to achieving such a balance. I used a micro-economic model where the explorative and exploitative activities are modeled in accordance with the definitions in March (1991). This model shows that the personal cost to the employee of performing activities was a crucial factor in determining their balancing of resources between exploration and exploitation. However, these personal costs are also the Achilles' heel of such balance calculations because information regarding this type of cost is incomplete and difficult, perhaps even impossible, for the owner or manager to obtain. Based on this and the process and output characteristics of exploratory activities, I argue that it is not appropriate to design a hard, quantitative performance measurement and incentive system to balance resource allocation between explorative and exploitative activities. The study shows that the solution to achieving such a balance must be found outside of the incentive system. Further, I posit that managing R&D departments requires the management to focus on enforcing productive workspaces and norms and not on performance measurement and associated disbursal of rewards/punishments. © 2022 The Author",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134230589

Thus, we find that interfirm networks in the form of BGs are a double-edged sword that can have both favorable and unfavorable consequences for international sales, depending on the geographical dispersion of the BG's ties. In addition, the results reveal that BG affiliation is more beneficial for smaller SMEs and SMEs in countries with lower institutional support that are more dependent on the network resources embedded within BG networks. © 2022 The Authors",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126145363

Their work has thus been argued to have detrimental effects on their partner relationships. This paper forwards the idea that work conditions of seafarers may lead to social detachment from their close social relations (e.g. family) and that these specifically cause seafarers to exhibit a different behaviour in terms of one of the most important decisions they make when coming ashore — residential location choice. Our empirical analysis of former Danish seafarers and a sample of matched traditional workers suggests that individuals who until recently worked as seafarer to a lesser extent rely on family-based social relations than traditional workers when making residential location choices. They chose to locate close to their former peers, suggesting a shift in social attachments. The isolated lifestyles of seafarers influence social attachment. Geographic distances and social contexts are shown to interact and affect their choice of residential location. This has implications for our understanding of the well-being of seafarers and may offer new aspects on the recent development of the work conditions of seafarers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132850679

This study presents the results of a structured literature review of 110 publications that developed scientometric portraits of 91 recognized scientists. Findings indicate that scientometric portraits are a growing topic in library & information science, scientometrics, and discipline-specific venues. Since 2010, the number of publications devoted to creating scientometric portraits has been growing steadily, reaching approximately seven works per year by 2019. 139 authors of scientometric portrait papers roughly fall into two categories of researchers: the majority, who have only contributed once, and a smaller group who have written many portraits and frequently cooperated with others. 65% of all scholars described in the portraits are Indian nationals. This reveals a great interest among Indian scholars in promoting domestic research. We recommend that authors of future scientometric portraits publish their work in discipline-specific outlets as such venues may better reach their target audience, focus on underrepresented disciplines, and recognize women scientists. They should also conduct a more comprehensive literature review to integrate previous findings and inform the study’s research methods to discover relevant variables, measures, metrics, and analysis techniques. Producing a scientometric portrait paper should not be considered a bibliometric exercise: the authors should put themselves in place of their readers—for instance, graduate students, academics, and policymakers—and find ways to inform and inspire them.

Within an ecosystem, the so-called orchestrator is considered to be one of the most important roles. However, extant research falls short of explaining how and why this orchestrator role and the resulting tasks of orchestration are allocated to specific ecosystem members. Based on a case study with eight cases, this paper aims to shed light on this crucial question. Our results revealed three basic patterns of ecosystem orchestration: single-, double-, and multi-orchestration ecosystems. These were determined by two key contingencies: production related knowledge and consumption related knowledge. This discovery yields several contributions to research and managerial practice. We show whether, and under which circumstances, orchestrators might include other ecosystem participants in the key tasks of orchestration. We demonstrate how orchestrators allocate these tasks to specific participants in the ecosystem. Furthermore, our results shed light on how orchestrators manage their ecosystem partners and secure their position within the ecosystem. And finally, we introduce a new view on the role of the orchestrator. © 2021 The Author(s)",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115011591

To limit this, targeted N regulation at the ID15 (1500 ha) level is slowly becoming a reality for farmers and authorities in Denmark. This paper explores the formulation of value propositions connected to developed technologies and concepts for retention mapping at the field level for more detailed targeted regulation. We explore all this through a comprehensive longitudinal ethnographic case study over a period of three years. We use the value proposition canvas to make sense of the viewpoints of the involved stakeholder groups. Our empirical setting is a large-scale research project in Denmark, a country that has high environmental goals regarding nitrogen loading. The publicly funded project involved a multitude of stakeholders, ranging from industry consultants, regulators, farmers and researchers from several disciplines. Important for our study is the fact that much of Denmark's regulation is based on a consensus-driven approach. Thus, it provides a compelling setting for exploring the creation of value propositions through multisector stakeholder engagement. Our findings indicate that, while there is a general movement towards targeted N regulation due to an advancement of knowledge, the practical side of its implementation is less straightforward. Here, stakeholder-formulated value propositions can facilitate this process, not only being connected to the measurement technology, but also relying on a link to a regulatory transformation. © 2022 The Authors",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123371657

It further contributes toward Fintech paradigm and research domain emergence that both to date remain yet elusive. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopted a multiple-case study strategy for the purpose of theory building. Seven players from the Fintech ecosystem in Quebec (Canada) were selected, representing financial institutions, Fintech start-ups and Quebec’s financial cluster. Primary data was collected via in-depth interviews with ten respondents at the level of vice presidents, Managers, directors, chief executive officers and founders, and unobtrusive data – in the form of running records, mass-media news reports, presentations and proceedings from Fintech events. Data analysis was informed by grounded theory methods and techniques. Findings: Grounded in data, this paper puts forward a typology of “comfort zoning” and its four types: nimbling, imperiling, cocooning and discomforting. Research limitations/implications: Following the tenets of the grounded theory, four criteria are used to evaluate the emergent theory: fit, relevance, workability and modifiability. It is expected the interpretation and adoption of comfort zoning typology will be challenged, modified and enhanced by Fintech researchers and practitioners. Practical implications: The comfort zoning typology would aid practitioners in their efforts to define and refine the domain of Fintech, problematize it and eventually enhance the relationship between Fintechs.

We investigate two types of aggregation biases that might affect CCH tests. First, monthly commodity prices are sometimes averaged across all days of the month, a practice that creates substantial spurious predictability in price changes. Second, in CCH tests commodity prices are often grouped into an index. If all commodity prices do not react equally fast to news, the active goods’ prices should lead those of the slower-acting ones and therefore predict the index. If so, the currency's value changes can proxy for these active goods’ prices. We find a strong bias from price averaging in monthly returns, while the bias from ignoring predictability among commodities seems weak. When testing the CCH using end-of-period data the supporting evidence is weak at best. © 2021",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122542323

We develop a large-scale stock-flow consistent model. The model has five main sectors namely, household, firms, financial corporations, government, and the rest of the world sectors. We use the model to explore the macroeconomic stability of the Danish economy, given the recent level of household debt. We fit the model to annual data from 1998 to 2016, estimate the structural parameters, and simulate the model for a baseline scenario, against which we compare and contrast the effects of different economic shocks. To assess the macroeconomic risks associated with high household debt, we introduce two shocks separately—a fall in house prices and a rise in interest rates—finding that these shocks have adverse effects on the economy. Focusing on macroeconomic stability, we find that private domestic demand seems to be relatively sensitive to the changes in interest rates and house prices, but the overall output is less affected, mainly due to strong current account surplus. Overall, it can be concluded that in the absence of global shocks, domestic shocks to the economy may not pose a serious risk to macroeconomic stability, when purely focusing on the sensitivity of output growth and unemployment. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116910072

The assessment is grounded in the empirical material of a three-year research project on integrated reporting (IR). Design/methodology/approach: Alvesson and Deetz’s (2021) critical management framework structures the arguments in this paper. By investigating local phenomena and the extant literature, the authors glean insights that they later critique, drawing on the empirical evidence collected during the research project. Transformative redefinitions are then proposed that point to future opportunities for research on voluntary organisational disclosures. Findings: The authors argue that the mainstream approaches to VRD, namely, incremental information and legitimacy theories, present shortcomings in addressing why and how organisations voluntarily disclose information. First, the authors find that companies adopting the International IR Council’s (IIRC, 2021) IR framework tend to comply with the framework only in an informal, rather than a substantial way. Second, the authors find that, at times, organisations serendipitously chance upon VRD practices such as IR instead of rationally recognising the potential ability of such practices to provide useful information for decision-making by investors. Also, powerful groups in organisations may use VRD practices to establish, maintain or restore power balances in their favour. Research limitations/implications: The paper’s limitations stem directly from its aim to be a critical reflection. Even when grounded on empirics, a reflection is mainly a subjective effort. Therefore, different researchers could come to different conclusions and offer different lessons from the two case studies. Practical implications: The different rationales the authors found for VRD should make a case for reporting institutions to tone down any investor-centric rhetoric in favour of more substantial disclosures.

However, economic, management, and technology forecasting research has up to now been hesitant to apply predictive modeling techniques and workflows. In this paper, we introduce to a machine learning (ML) approach to quantitative analysis geared towards optimizing the predictive performance, contrasting it with standard practices inferential statistics which focus on producing good parameter estimates. We discuss the potential synergies between the two fields against the backdrop of this at first glance, target-incompatibility. We discuss fundamental concepts in predictive modeling, such as out-of-sample model validation, variable and model selection, generalization and hyperparameter tuning procedures. Providing a hands-on predictive modelling for an quantitative social science audience, while aiming at demystifying computer science jargon. We use the example of high-quality patent identification guiding the reader through various model classes and procedures for data preprocessing, modelling and validation. We start of with more familiar easy to interpret model classes (Logit and Elastic Nets), continues with less familiar non-parametric approaches (Classification Trees and Random Forest) and finally presents artificial neural network architectures, first a simple feed-forward and then a deep autoencoder geared towards anomaly detection. Instead of limiting ourselves to the introduction of standard ML techniques, we also present state-of-the-art yet approachable techniques from artificial neural networks and deep learning to predict rare phenomena of interest. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Book Chapter,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131127478

Unfortunately, there is no agreed method by which governments can differentiate between entrepreneurs and target them with the appropriate promotion policies. Thus, despite the good intentions, entrepreneurship policy initiatives have been incorrectly targeted, poorly implemented, and without the desired results, since different entrepreneurs may require different forms of assistance. Some scholars have suggested that without a context-specific classificatory guide, policymakers are unlikely to be accurate in their assessment of the growth capabilities of prospective candidates for specific promotion initiatives and this can explain some of the policy failures. This observation has motivated the present paper.

The analysis focuses on similarities and deviations of BM configurations among 80 companies operating in the industry sector related to Phantom Limb Pain (PLP). Leveraging a questionnaire-based mapping tool, the results show that companies operating within the area of PLP treatment apply relatively similar BM configurations. This indicates that companies mostly imitate the successful BMs of their main competitors in the industry as a whole and in their specific sub-groups, thus potentially ignoring the opportunity to also compete on a BM level. The contribution brought by the paper is twofold. First, it adds to the research stream on BM configurations by showing that this concept can be used not only to analyze and foster cross-industry BM imitation, but also to explore and examine intra-industry BM imitation (or differentiation). Second, the article contributes to the research stream on intra-industry BM imitation by going beyond prior anecdotal evidence and empirically testing the existence of the phenomenon of intra-industry BM imitation and hence, the potential innovation space on a BM level. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124314684

This is an empirical study based on 113 surveys of managers/entrepreneurs from the Estonian IT sector. The questionnaire was uploaded onto the online platform of connect.ee and the participants were invited to complete it. The study reveals that only conscientiousness positively and significantly predicts causation logic. However, four of the five factors of personality traits positively and significantly predict effectuation logic, i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, except for neuroticism. Furthermore, only nine of 25 hypotheses are positive and significant, and of the 11 relationships of the model, three are negative and non-significant for causation logic and eight are negative and non-significant for effectuation logic. Finally, there are another five relationships of the model which are positively but non-significantly related. Managers of IT companies in Estonia should think of shifting to effectuation logic as most personality traits predict effectuation logic, and therefore, there is the possibility of a better performance for IT firms. Eight of the 51 items of the model had standardised regression weights below the threshold of 0.500, but only four were extracted from the final model. The extraction of items from the model indicates the need for the re-identification of the constructs of personality traits using, for example, the six-factor personality traits. © 2021 by the authors.

Though the existing literature has suggested fiscal decentralization strategies between different local government levels, few of the studies ascertain garbage classification efficiency from a quantitative perspective. To bridge the gap, this study examines the optimal fiscal decentralization strategies for garbage classification. It uses an optimization model while considering decision makers’ requirements regarding the fund allocation amounts at different government levels and the classification ratios in villages as constraints and decisions, respectively. A three-stage heuristic algorithm is applied to determine optimal landfill locations and efficient classification ratios for the garbage processing system in rural China, with an analytical discussion on the propositions and properties of the model. Our analytical results suggest that 1) the theoretically optimal solution is conditionally achievable, 2) the applied algorithm can achieve the optimal solution faster when the relationship between governance costs and classification ratios reaches some mathematical conditions, and 3) there is always a potential for increasing the retained funds between different government levels or for reducing the total appropriation from the county government. The numerical experiment on a primary dataset from 12 towns and 143 villages in the Pingyuan county of Guangdong province, China, does not only affirm the qualitative results, but it also provides insights into the difficulties encountered during the implementation of the garbage classification policy in China’s rural areas. © Copyright © 2021 Ma, Huang, Li, Hu, P.

After a brief outline of the existing EU legislation on accounting and a discussion on whether accounting law is part of company law, some examples of accounting concepts in company law – i.e. examples of accounting concepts that have been ‘implemented’ in company law – are discussed, drawing on the Consolidated Company Law Directive (CCLD) and the Shareholder Rights Directive (SRD 2) as well as the International Accounting Standards (IAS) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These examples are related party transactions, consideration other than in cash and fair value, serious loss of the subscribed capital as well as a few other examples.

Balancing the pros and cons, in the author’s opinion, it is mostly positive that accounting concepts are used in company law in areas where this makes sense – and hence, in the author’s opinion, accounting concepts in company law are mainly a ‘good’ thing. © 2021 De Gruyter.

The design of entrepreneurship policies has been debated extensively. In formulating policies, one of the major questions that emerges is whether policies should promote the entry of more entrepreneurs into the market, and if yes, which type of entry should be promoted, and how can it be implemented? On the one hand, excess entry can lead to a significant waste of resources because the majority of new entrepreneurs fail within a short period, and very few achieve the societal goal of high growth and job creation. On the other hand, focusing on promoting only attractive entrepreneurs, from society’s point of view, might be an impossible exercise. Recently a different rationale for entrepreneurship policy has been suggested, arguing that entrepreneurship is largely about experimentation, where ideas are carried from firm to firm by individuals, despite failures along the way. This chapter discusses these policy directions, reviews the recent literature and points to the future direction of entrepreneurship policy. © Designs and Patents Act 1988.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104801234

The study adopts a longitudinal single-case design to analyze the introduction of MNE pump technology, which provides clean water in Kenyan rural villages. The findings show that a lack of understanding of the local BoP context leads to failure in mobilizing relevant actors for the intended water-provision network and, subsequently, to an initial rejection of the technology. By focusing more on the local actors and by mobilizing additional actors, the MNE technology is successfully translated into the BoP context—albeit without the intended creation of MNE value.

Using a firm-and institutional-level analysis, our study investigates a critical case from the Bangladeshi garment industry and explores the reasons, rooted in institutions and the business system, that cause firms to become ‘locked in’ at a particular stage of the upgrading ladder. We analyse the nature of the institutions and business systems of Bangladesh and examine how the characteristics of institutions and business systems affect firms’ lock-in. Our study explores four causes of ‘lock-in’: i) a lack of socially-constructed entrepreneurial vision (i.e. focusing on multiple venture creation, political affiliation and power, supply and manufacturing capacity and profit maximization) and ii) ownership and management characteristics, which do not support upgrading to own brand manufacturing (OBM), iii) the nature of governance between buyers and suppliers, and iv) inconsistency in institutional characteristics. The latter issue is seen, for example, in low levels of trust between firms, a lack of government incentives for design lab development and brand internationalisation, inadequate management of bank financing for upgrading, a lack of intermediary institutions to support internationalisation, and low-quality management education. Our study contributes to the GVC and business systems literature by exploring the reasons for the ‘lock-in’ condition that existing literatures have ignored. © Mohammad B. Rana and Matthew M.C.

Drawing on internationalization and GVC perspectives, we examine the critical case of DBL Apparel Company from Bangladesh, which supplies many global brands, including Sweden’s H & M, and has internationalized into Ethiopia. As the company appears to be the first Bangladeshi garment firm to have internationalized, we conduct an in-depth examination over a three-year period of the process and the antecedents affecting the firm’s overseas expansion. We explore how the buyer’s business model, institutional features, and the supplier’s entrepreneurial capability influence DBL’s internationalization. In particular, our study demonstrates how the buyer’s market-driving approach, value creation, delivery, and proposition shape how the buyer shows commitment to the supplier’s internationalization. At the same time, the supplier’s entrepreneurial capability, consisting of visionary leadership, commitment, learning intent, absorptive capacity, and dynamic management skills contribute to its decision to internationalize. Our analysis reveals that a supplier firm does not move toward internationalization based on one-sided commitment only; instead, it is the ‘shared commitment’ of both buyer and supplier in the GVC that contributes to the supplier’s decision to internationalize. We also demonstrate the influence of institutional characteristics in both home and host countries, particularly the role of government and the logics of doing business that facilitate the internationalization decision and process.

Most countries have adopted a strategy of strict lockdowns, leading to a fall in production and a rise in unemployment. From an economic perspective, this lockdown has erupted in supply-and-demand shocks in the economy. In order to investigate the potential impact of these shocks, we develop a post-Keynesian empirical Stock-Flow Consistent (SFC) model for Denmark. The impact of these shocks is analyzed in three different scenarios. Overall, our simulation results indicate that temporary (1 year) shocks in the economy will lead to a fall in output but a quick recovery, whereas persistent shocks can lead to a full-blown economic crisis. We find that the impact of these shocks can be lowered by public intervention in the form of fiscal stimulus, which can reduce the impact of these shocks and also improve the speed of economic recovery. We also address the economic consequences of financing this stimulus, and whether such a policy response is feasible. Our main conclusion is that fiscal stimulus seems to be an effective and affordable policy option available to Denmark. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121862594

(2018), case studies illustrating creative-problem solving at work is lacking. To help fill this gap, this study aims to show how metaphorical creativity was integrated in the realm of everyday creativity to form a new soap that solves a cleaning crew's challenge. Design/methodology/approach: Participatory observation was the qualitative methodology used to conduct this study. The cleaning team understood they were the research participants under investigation in the food plant. Participatory observation favored an efficient and flexible process for the cleaners to demonstrate their experiential knowledge while the researchers documented the cleaners' routine cleaning practices and challenges. Directly observing and analyzing the cleaners' everyday creative acts inferred face validity. This ensured to a degree that the study was effective at exploring everyday creativity. Findings: Following Finke's Geneplore model in creative cognition (Birdsell, 2019), the consultant shifted between cycles of analogical reasoning in the generative process with exploratory processes to test hypothesis and tailor his thinking. Through this process, the consultant leveraged everyday creativity to develop a small innovation of foaming a non-foaming soap. The foaming process changed the soap's chemistry, enabling the cleaners to remove the spot quickly, accelerating the cleaning process. Research limitations/implications: According to Mumford et al. (2018), case studies illustrating creative-problem solving at work are lacking. In this study, we aim to show how metaphorical creativity was integrated into the realm of everyday creativity to form a new soap that solves an industrial cleaning crew's challenge. To fully understand the variety of metaphorical creativity more qualitative cases need to be analyzed and qualitative research is needed to grasp the scale of metaphorical creativity in everyday creativity. Practical implications: The findings gleaned from this study are beneficial to help organizations solve problems. Viewing problems metaphorically in everyday creativity involves unconventional thinking. When confronted with a challenge that seems impossible to solve, employees should approach the problem from a different angle. Sometimes, a small, innovative act can solve problems that appear hopeless, similar to the Columbus Principle. After all, a challenge is only simple once you know how to pull it off – the triumph is having the courage to try something new and succeeding. With practice, metaphorical creativity is a skill that one can develop. This could e.g. be viewing old problems through a new lens. Applying a new approach may reveal an unconventional solution. Originality/value: According to Mumford et al. (2018), case studies illustrating creative-problem solving at work are lacking. To help fill this gap, this study aims to show how metaphorical creativity was integrated into the realm of everyday creativity to form a new soap that solves a cleaning crew's challenge. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101469637
